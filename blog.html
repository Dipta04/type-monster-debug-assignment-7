    <h3>What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?</h3>
    <p>sessionStorage is almost similar to localStorage . The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</p>
    <h3>What is the difference between Block Scope and Global Scope?</h3>
    <h4>Global Scope:</h4>
    <p>A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.</p>
    <h4>Block Scope:</h4>
    <P>The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.But block statements don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.</P>
